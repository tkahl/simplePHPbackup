Simple PHP Backup Script
====
There are a lot of powerful Backup-Tools available - but somehow i could not find the right one for me.

This tool does what I want ;) (most of the time…):

* Can be started via command line and uses parameters i need
* Creates default ZIP-files
* Password protect the ZIP-files
* Upload the files to an FTP-Server
* Creates one full and x incremental backups based on an interval
	* daily
	* weekly (default)
	* monthly
	* yearly
* Ignores unwanted directories by default (.git, …)
* …

I use it for example to backup my PHP-projects every hour with a weekly interval. This way, i have a backup of my changes in small steps with a full backup every week. It is uploaded to a cloud storage, so even if my local machines are damaged / lost / …, i still have all my important files.

I know, that i might be a bit paranoid (TimeMachine, Local Backup, weekly disk image and this additional file backup) - but it makes me feel better :)
